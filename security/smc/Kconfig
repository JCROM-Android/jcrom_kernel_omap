	  This option enables crypto subsystem to use SMC and OMAP hardware
	  accelerators.

config SMC_KERNEL_CRYPTO_STANDALONE
	bool "Make SMC work without the Protected App"
	depends on SMC_KERNEL_CRYPTO
	default y
	help
	  The crypto driver can work with a running Protected App, and to do so
          it needs to communicate with the Protected App to share the hardware
          encryption engines.  If you are not using a Protected App, say yes here
          so the kernel does not try to communicate with a non-existent app.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer Y.
